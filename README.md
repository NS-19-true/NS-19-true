## About

I started building robots in 2019, during my first months as an engineering student, when I constructed a basic four-wheeled go-kart from scratch. That was the initial push that drove deeper interest in how mathematics, control theory, and algorithms manifest as real physical behavior. Through years of prototyping, simulation, and experimentation, I became able to give an idea a physical form as robotic models.

You can refer to the Autonomous VTOL or the Robot Dog Stem kits listed in my public repositories for reference.

After graduation, I focused on strengthening my foundations in algorithms and systems. I worked at Programiz, where I developed professional courses on Data Structures and Algorithms and helped build a beginner-friendly competitive programming platform. In parallel, I co-founded the YouTube channel *Third World Nerd* to explain engineering concepts through practical, experiment-driven storytelling. This later evolved into the founding of Axar Space Pvt. Ltd., under which we created Makit Labs, a platform for hands-on robotics and STEM education. Through this work, I have taught over 500 students and open-sourced multiple projects, including a quadruped robot inspired by the Stanford Pupper.

So far, much of my work so far has been exploratory and driven by curiosity, however moving forward, I wish to contribute meaningfully to solving real life problems through my creations.

Here's to hoping when I re-do this README.md in a few years time, it will read " I started building robots in 2019 and since then I have helped 1000s of people accross the world. "

## Research Interests

My primary interests lie in areas that form the backbone of modern autonomous and distributed robotic systems:

- Control Systems and Estimation  
- Communication Systems and Signal Processing  
- Multi-agent and Distributed Robotics   
- Reinforcement Learning for Physical Systems  

Communication theory, in particular, plays a central role in reliable sensing, synchronization, data exchange, and coordinated decision-making in autonomous vehicles and robotic swarms. Building a strong theoretical base in these areas, along with exposure to their industrial and research applications, is a long-term goal for me.
